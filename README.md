# Share Assets Between Stacks  â€“ Contentstack Extension

## About this extension

For effective management of our website content and related assets, we often make use of multiple stacks. We might have use cases where we are required to use assets from one stack in another stack. Moving assets manually from one stack to another can be time consuming. Therefore, we have developed an extension that enables users to share assets between stacks.
